https://www.blockchain.com/btc/block-height/0 is a current info copy in web browser format,
 easy on the eyes and various points of interest including a copy of the valid BTC blockchain succeeding release of gen block
 and also from the main 64 zero hash, but no page for the zero hash :(
    not maintained by scavng3r this is blockchain.info

so what is?

just a glitch??? because the decode to base64? or is this normal?  im such a noob here
anyways just for reference
here is the zero hash and the message encoded together
